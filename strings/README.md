# Strings

A string is an array of characters stored back-to-back(contiguos).

Since each string is an arrays of characters, each characters within an array has consecutive addresses as they are stored next to each other in memory. Strings themselves might have different addresses.

Other data types in C e.g **int**s or **float** are generally passed and stored as their values since they are always fixed bumber of bytes. Strings on the other hand,are passed as their address as they could be really long.
