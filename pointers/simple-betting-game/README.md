We demonstrate how memory is allocated in stack on file one Memory allocated on stack memory is cleared automatically.

 File two demosntrates how to allocate memory dynamically using **malloc** (in the heap section of the memory) and deallocates it using function **free**

On both files we have global variables which are allocated memory at global section of the memory. This variables are cleared automatically when program finishes.
