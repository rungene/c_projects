#Environment
The shell uses an environment list, where environment variables are “stored”.

The list is an array of strings, with the following format: **var=value**, where **var** is the name of the variable and **value** its value. As a reminder, you can list the environment with the command **printenv**

##1-env-main. - printenv with environ 
Write a program that prints enviroment using the global variable **environ.**
