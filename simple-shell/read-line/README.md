#Simple Shell
##Read Line
man 3 **getline**
A basic shell that prints a prompt, waits for user to enter command and prints what they entered on the next line

##man strtok
After reading the user inputs in the shell, break the command into individual strings. You break the comands to execute them.
We use standard library **strtok** for tokenization(convert single string int tokens of trings).
